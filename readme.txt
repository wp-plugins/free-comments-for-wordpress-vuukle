Vuukle is comments where credibility counts. Everyone hates going through tons of fake comments and reviews and we are fixing that.

== Description ==
What is Vuukle?
How my project is going to benefit you?
These are the two main areas:
In the current scenario, internet has taken the place to influence the evaluation of any product, service or information by inviting people comments and reviews. More and more people have started taking interest across the world to give their views about anything. Increasing the number of participants has forced the business entity that faces competition in the market to have more and more opinions about their own product, service or information.
Now every innovation has pros and cons. Similarly inviting reviews and comments also have the same consequences. The major challenges are as follows:
1.       Comments may be given by a competitor’s network which may be false to spoil the image of the original business entity.
2.       It may also be given by people who do not have expertise and their reviews and comments may be distorted as it may not be intentional. So the end users or readers of those comments may be misled by the above factors.

This is where Vuukle comes in the picture to solve these two problems
At present there is no software in the market to stop the two kind of opinions listed above which can create distortion in the mind of the end users
I have developed a software which basically helps the business entity to solve these two problems. Vuukle helps them to avoid distorted, scrupulous, biased reviews and comments.

How will Vuukle do this?
As my software is linked with Facebook and LinkedIn, it will capture the identity of all the people who give their reviews or comments.
This will help prevent people using fake identities. So this is an additional advantage of using my software.

Now I am going one step further. When a person comments and gives their review, we get further feedback on those comments whether people liked those comments or not. This is incorporated in my algorithm to evaluate the credibility of the original commenters. And this creates the credibility score of a user which currently no one else is providing at the moment.

There is another advantage of using my software. Since people want to know everything through the internet and they heavily rely on the reviews and comments to know about products, services and information they become so confused among the vast jungle of comments because of misleading comments that they cannot decide whom to trust and who not to. After installing my software, it helps the end user/public to know the credibility scores of the commentators and give them the confidence to rely on the people who have high credibility scores.
